## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### 🔑 API Key Security

**✅ Do:**
- Store API keys in environment variables
- Use `.env` files for local development (never commit them)
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use separate keys for different environments
- Monitor API key usage in your dashboard

**❌ Don't:**
- Hardcode API keys in source code
- Share API keys in chat/email
- Commit `.env` files to version control
- Use production keys in development
- Log API keys in application logs

### 🌐 Network Security

**✅ Recommended:**
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement request timeout limits
- Use firewall rules to restrict outbound connections
- Monitor API usage and rate limits
- Implement proper error handling to avoid information leakage

### 📱 Client-Side Security

**✅ MCP Client Security:**
- Never expose API keys to client-side code
- Run MCP server in secure environments only
- Use least-privilege access principles
- Regularly update MCP client applications
- Monitor MCP server logs for suspicious activity

### 🔧 Configuration Security

**✅ Secure Configuration:**
```bash
# ✅ Good - Environment variable
export LEADMAGIC_API_KEY="your-secure-api-key"

# ✅ Good - .env file (not committed)
LEADMAGIC_API_KEY=your-secure-api-key

# ❌ Bad - Hardcoded in code
const apiKey = "<API_KEY>"; // NEVER DO THIS
```

## 🚫 Known Security Considerations

### ⚠️ Environment Variables

**Risk**: API keys in environment variables can be accessed by any process
**Mitigation**: 
- Use secure environment variable management
- Restrict process access permissions
- Monitor environment variable access

### ⚠️ Network Interception

**Risk**: API requests could be intercepted
**Mitigation**:
- Always use HTTPS (enforced by default)
- Implement certificate pinning if needed
- Use VPN for sensitive environments

### ⚠️ Rate Limiting

**Risk**: API abuse or DoS attacks
**Mitigation**:
- Built-in rate limiting respect
- Configurable timeout settings
- Monitor API usage patterns
